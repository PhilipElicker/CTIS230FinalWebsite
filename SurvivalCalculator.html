		<h2 class="TextHeading">How To Use The Calculator</h2>
		<p>You will be asked 5 questions to determine how long you could survive in Level 0 of the backrooms. All information regarding Level 0 was obtained from the Back Rooms Wiki.</p>
		<p><strong>Please indicate on a scale of 0 to 10 how well you would be able to handle the environmental or physiological stressor listed</strong>, with 0 being you are poorly equipped to handle the stressor, and 10 being you could handle the stressor without any difficulty.
</p>
<br>
<p>1. The fluorescent lighting in Level 0 hums constantly, which has been reported to wear on travelers rather quickly. It's likely your mental state will decline much more rapidly if you tend to get easily irritated by high pitch noises or suffer from tinnitus.
</p>
<div class="slider-container">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="mySlider1">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your Value: <span id="sliderValue1">5</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>2. There are very few resources in Level 0, including food and water. Some people experience detrimental health consequences if they don't eat or drink for extended periods of time.
</p>
<div class="slider-container">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="mySlider2">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your Value: <span id="sliderValue2">5</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>3. Travelers in Level 0 are completely isolated and have no human interaction. Introverts may be better equipped to handle the isolation present in Level 0 than extroverts.
</p>
<div class="slider-container">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="mySlider3">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your Value: <span id="sliderValue3">5</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>4. People who enter Level 0 are thrust into an unfamiliar setting with limited information. If you are easily distressed by unfamiliar and confusing situations, you may experience high levels of stress and anxiety. People who are indecisive and lack the ability to think on their feet may become frozen in fear and confusion when in Level 0.
</p>
<div class="slider-container">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="mySlider4">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your Value: <span id="sliderValue4">5</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>5. Information is possibly the most important factor in thriving in challenging situations. If you are someone who is conscientious and constantly aware of your surroundings, you will have a leg up over people who lack this crucial skill.
</p>
<div class="slider-container">
    <input type="range" min="0" max="10" value="5" class="slider" id="mySlider5">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Your Value: <span id="sliderValue5">5</span></p>
  </div>
