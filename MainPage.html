	<h2 class="TextHeading">What Is A Liminal Space?</h2>
	<p> Liminal space images often depict places of transition, such as an airport, but devoid of people or typical signs of human presence. Many liminal space images depict public places that are familiar to most people, which can result in a sense of nostalgia for these images, despite never physically being in the place the image depicts. Many liminal space images feel “off” due to their lack of context in addition to depicting places that lack a purpose, such as a doorway leading to a brick wall.

		If you enjoy liminal spaces and found footage style horror films, Kane Pixels has created an excellent video series based on people “no-clipping” through reality into a nearly infinite monotone yellow liminal space inhabited by dangerous monsters and bacteria.
