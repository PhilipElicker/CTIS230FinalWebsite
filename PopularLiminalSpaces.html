		<h2 class="TextHeading">How Did Liminal Space Images First Become Popular?</h2>
		<p>The idea of liminal spaces was first popularized by a post to 4chan which included this creepy image of an
			abandoned office building accompanied by the following text.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>“<em>If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms,
				where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background
				noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of
				randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.
				God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.</em>”

		<h2 class="TextHeading">What Is Another Popular Liminal Space Image?</h2>
		<p>Another popular liminal space is this image of a boxed in building with windows. Unlike the original 4chan
			post, this image was taken at a traceable location, which happens to be in an airport hotel in London. The
			Backrooms Wiki made an article inspired by this image where they used it to describe "Level 188" of the
			Backrooms project.
